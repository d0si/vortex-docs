## Overview

Vortex Framework project is easy to learn and use backend web framework. It provides the most needed set of tools to begin working on projects from small simple webpages to much larger applications.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy to learn and use framework with its included functionality that can be easily extended and customized to your needs.


The whole concept is based on MVC (model-view-controller) like pattern but with more freedom allowed. Customizable [router](concepts/router.md) first parses the request url to determine which [controller](concepts/controller.md) is responsible for handling such url. Then controller executes and uses [view](concepts/view.md) to output the results which will be seen in response.
